Code to Analyze (${language}):
${code}

Please provide a detailed complexity analysis:

## Time Complexity
- **Big O Notation**: Provide the time complexity with justification
- **Best Case**: Analysis of optimal input scenario
- **Average Case**: Typical performance expectation
- **Worst Case**: Analysis of challenging input scenario

## Space Complexity
- **Memory Usage**: Additional space beyond input
- **Auxiliary Space**: Extra variables, data structures
- **Stack Space**: For recursive algorithms

## Optimization Opportunities
- Potential improvements to reduce complexity
- Alternative approaches with better performance
- Trade-offs between time and space

## Scalability Assessment
- How the solution performs with large inputs
- Memory constraints considerations
- Performance bottlenecks identification

Format in markdown with clear mathematical notation where applicable.`;
